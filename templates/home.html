            <h2>About VORP Vision</h2>
            <p>Draft the right player at the right time. This tool shows you how.</p>

            <h3>What is VORP?</h3>
            <p><strong>Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)</strong> measures how much better a player is compared to
                the next replacement-level option at their position. It highlights where the biggest positional
                drop-offs happen, so you know which positions matter most in each round.</p>

            <h3>What is VOAS?</h3>
            <p><strong>Value Over Average Starter (VOAS)</strong> compares a player’s projected points to what an
                average starter at their position would score. This shows who truly gives your lineup a weekly edge, not
                just who is better than a bench player.</p>

            <h3>Why it matters</h3>
            <p>Fantasy drafts are about opportunity cost. Taking a wide receiver early might mean missing the last elite
                running back. Waiting too long on tight end could leave you with a weekly gap. VORP and VOAS cut through
                the noise and reveal which positions are most valuable now versus later.</p>

            <h3>Use it during Sleeper drafts</h3>
            <p>VORP Vision isn’t just a website—you can also install the Chrome extension to use live during your
                Sleeper drafts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overlay:</strong> Rankings and VORP/VOAS values appear right on the Sleeper draft board.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Projections are blended from ESPN, CBS, and Draft Sharks for balanced
                    accuracy.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Smart features:</strong> Drafted players auto-hide, position filters and tiers are built-in,
                    and you can switch between VORP and VOAS views.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Personalized:</strong> Replacement level and average starter values adapt to your league
                    size and roster setup.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My intent</h3>
            <p>I built this because I love the strategy of fantasy football. Rankings alone don’t tell the full
                story—context does. VORP Vision helps you see who is most important to draft each round so you can make
                sharper choices with confidence.</p>
